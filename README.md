# No data

No data is the best way to secure your database. Store nothing, serve nowhere.

> Inspired by [no code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode). Not affiliated.

## Our guarantee

No data is secure; no server cannot be penetrated.

## Getting started

Start by not having any data.

```sh

```

## Querying the database

No data integrates naturally with its spiritual predecessor: no code. Query the database however you like.

```sh

```

You can also update the entries.

```sh

```

The possibilities are endless.

## Hosting your data

No data integrates naturally with its sister framework: no server. Run the following command to host your data absolutely nowhere.

```sh

```

Now that you haven't done anything, you should see this output:

```sh

```

It's that simple.

## Contributing

- If you want to contribute, please don't.

  Our vision is to host nothing. All changes are welcome, provided they:

    1. Do not contain any data, in accordance to our vision.
    1. Do not unnecessarily reimplement features that are already implemented.

- If you encounter a problem, please solve it yourself.

  Issues are unnecessary. No code is bug-free; no data is secure; no server cannot be penetrated.
